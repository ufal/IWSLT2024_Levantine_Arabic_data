The important thing was, that there appeared a competition
Its name was “youth employment competition”
It was in the Office of Personal Affairs
So I applied for it.
They required … The competencies which they required was that one should be a graduate in English literature or English language
So I applied and was accepted.
I worked as an employee at the Office of Personal Affairs
This office provides services to citizens
In case they need identification documents such as family certificate, marriage certificate, birth certificate, the personal statement or even the family register, or the registration of all the events that happen between the births, deaths and marriages.
So, these things.
Like this I stayed... I was employed in it until 2015.
Of course, here I practically forgot the English language,
Given that I didn’t practice the language
Simply, the employment I was working at has nothing to do with language
Anyway, as a result of the conditions of the war, security...
By the way, I forgot to say that all of my siblings have travelled to Europe through a scholarship.
I mean, given that they were the first ones at their university
So they did well and this made it possible for them to get a scholarship in Europe
My brother went to … he has a PhD in physics, and my older sister has a PhD in economics, and the second brother in economics, they have doctorates.
So they did well, my two sisters, I have two sisters here in France and my brother is in Holland.
Of course, they’ve got the citizenship.
I was the only one who stayed with my mom in Syria after my father's death in 2003, I stayed.
Until I left in 2015 because of the conditions of the war
So, an accident happened to me, so I could not stay any longer in this country, and my life became in danger
So, I came to France because I wanted … as a refugee, I applied for asylum.
First my sister applied for me a long-term visa for one year
So, in this way, with this visa, I arrived here in France, and a month later I submitted my papers to obtain refugee status
And here the procedures here in France, the administrative procedures take a lot of time
There is no... it’s not good at the desired level
There are many complications and a lot of delays in processing files and dossiers for anyone who wants to apply for asylum
Getting a residence card takes more than one and a half years long
As for the renewal, there is something called CBC
It’s like a document with a picture on it, and it stands for an identity card
But it is a identification document which states that I’m a refugee
It is for a limited period, for example, three months and its renewal is possible after three months
And this, for example, in order to renew the document, sometimes, I might have to spend a night ahead in front of the prefecture
We must spend the night before it, so that in the morning we can enter, for example, the prefecture for the renewal of the CBC.
Every time I was suffering from this situation
I mean that sometimes I would stand in line and like that.
And then in the end, they say “really the number that we take today is for example 400 people or 500 people”.
And I for example I can have number 403, so it means that I missed it by three people.
This happened to me often until I obtained the residence card
And here at this period, around a year ++ that I have to take a language courses, from the government...
And of course, my sister prepared my documents for the university for studying the French language, given that I don’t know, I don’t have a command of the French language.
In Syria, the second language is English, so I have no knowledge of the language
Here, the language was very difficult, somehow.
I studied at Sorbonne several levels.
And then I started thinking about studying at the university
I applied in 2007, I was thirty seven years old
I applied to a university and they accepted me, on a level, which was the B2, but this level was not sufficient.
Now, legally, here, according to the law of the country one has the right to get the permanent residence permit after he has been in the country for five continuous years without going abroad for ninety days or something like that.
So as for me, I was working, I had no problems, no penalties, no trials or anything like that at all
So... the company that I was working in, there is, because it’s international, an international company, so many foreigners come to work there.
Alright, and there was like a... like an agency which helps the employees to deal with the administrative issues with the state
So there was... I contacted them, or they contacted me
They told me, you are in this situation, you have been in the country for three years, so after two years you’ll have the right to apply for the permanent residence, would you like us to help you?
I told them of course
Okay, after I have spent here the five years... I contacted the... the... the agency
I told them that I have the right now to apply for the permanent residence, if they could help me
They told me okay, of course
But they required from me the last decision concerning... the status I had, which was the international protection, with the last positive decision from the Ministry of Interior.
Okay, and the employment contract, the lease agreement for the flat that I was renting, and other papers I am not sure of, like that one has no record, or debts or offences or something
So these were the things, the other papers which I don’t have much experience with, so it was the agency who did that
Alright, I applied for the permanent residence, in ninety days I got the permanent residence permit
At the time I got the permanent residence I gave up the right for the international protection or the right for asylum for example, because I can’t have two residence permits, okay.
So when I got the permanent residence permit I told them, to the Ministry of interior, right, I have the permanent residence now and I gave up the right for the international protection
So now I, the Czech government gave me a passport called “alien’s passport”, okay
This passport was issued by the Czech governemnt alright and I have the right to travel with it within Schengen, okay.
Then there are many countries that don’t accept this passport which is called “alien’s passport”, many Arab countries don’t accept this passport
I think that Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia I went there... I visited to see my family and this passport was accepted, I obtained the visa with it.
But other countries, honestly I don’t know because I didn’t think, didn’t think about visiting an Arab country with this passport, so as for the rest of the countries I don’t know honestly,
I should go ask to the embassies to know whether I can... if this passport is accepted, accepted or no
Now of course, at this time, I have, this year, I have been in... in... here in Czechia for seven years.
and according to the law, after, after seven years I have the right to apply for the citizenship
Of course, I sure would like to apply for the citizenship, but it’s not an easy thing
The citizenship as they say it’s not, it’s not a right, it’s a privilege.
And I have to make many more steps, and it must... the most important point is the language
I think that the language, the required level is B1 or B2, I’m not sure exactly
But of course, sure I would like to go... to go... or to apply for the Czech citizenship, sure, this is my country now
What the Czech state offered me I won’t... I won’t ever forget, its merit towards me.
Anyway, at the same time I make sure that I'm eating well, so that I can study
And I organize my food and also my life in general
And otherwise I also personally like a lot going to the club, to the gym.
To the sport gym to release the negative energy, you know how the person gets tired after studying, for example
So I like, for example at night, before I go to sleep, around nine o'clock, to go the gym.
And, it helps me to release the negative energy and start my next day with the same strength, with the same vigor and activity, and so on.
And also because, let's say, that studying sometimes makes you bored
So we can say that it’s a useful activity, and it’s fun at the same time.
Maybe I do it to break the routine a little bit.
That's it.
Hello Natalia, how are you? I hope you are fine.
You asked me to send you a recording regarding what the study is like, especially in a foreign country, and like that
For example, the exam period..., as a medical student, I can try to help you
And tell you my own experience
So, first of all, I mean, of course, like as a medical student, I am frankly obliged to study almost all the year
But just as you said, there are periods, in which studying is more intense and there is more of it.
There are two periods for us, I mean us in a particular.
At Christmas time, there is Christmas holiday.
And also in June, around June and July or so we have to study a lot.
Of course, the first thing, one... I mean this thing may be evolving over the years
So always one keeps trying as much as he can to improve himself every year and like that.
Of course, I have been here for four years, so at first it is difficult, and then it gets easier gradually.
And always I intend to surround myself with people who study, I mean people like me, and they have the same ambition like me, I mean that they get good grades and so on.
it's just sometimes I mean, one is not in the mood, frankly, to study and like this.
But you certainly know how one must push himself sometimes.
So what should we do, for example, it’s possible instead of, for example... I like to study on my own a lot.
But sometimes we study together, like a group.
And sometimes we go to the study room for example, where we live in the students’ dormitory.
And, what else, it is also possible, for example, to meet with my friends from the university and study with them so that I do not get distracted and like that
Yeah, I may also try as much as I can to ask older people than me about their experience and how to study better for the exams
And from where to start studying and like that
Yeah we go to cafes sometimes and we study there, nice and calm cafes.
Mmm that's it
I also make... I make sure that I also try to make a kind of a studying schedule.
Yes, so that at least I have something to follow, you know.
Like I have something that I follow, that I have a study schedule, like that.
And hmm, that's it I think
No, I think I have nothing else to add.
That's it.
When I came to France, the struggle with administrative procedures began.
As I have a colon disease, the cold is what makes me sick
I went with my sister to start applying for asylum
Here, I had to take an appointment from the municipality, but in order to get an appointment, I had to go to another place, and stand in a long and wide line
And finally, they give a paper to the first 75 people and to the rest they say: come tomorrow
I went there day after day, in the cold and it did not go well.
We even found some people who brought mattresses and quilts, and they were sleeping in front of the building
So here we lost hope.
I tried … my sister tried at other municipalities until she was finally able to get an appoinment in the municipality of Créteil, in the south of France, of Paris.
And then they told me: you should make a file explaning your story.
In the end, we went to an institution belonging to the United Nations Organization and met a young law graduate of Moroccan origin.
She did not understand my dialect, for in Morocco they speak in a completely different dialect from our dialect,
and she really formulated the story in a professional way.
I submitted the file to the institution and obtained asylum after I had an interview with a French investigator with a Lebanese translator, whose dialect is almost the same as our Syrian dialect.
Of course, the procedures were long, given that the number of refugees in France is very high, and the number of Syrian refugees gets around hundred thousand out of million refugees of different nationalities.
Okay, hello!
The primary or nursery school
In Syria we have no such thing as “nursery“.
It’s not compulsory. It depends on the family, if they can afford to put their child into nursery.
So the child attends private nursery school.
We don’t have a public one, nor governmental, nor in the education system. We have no such thing as “preschool“ or obligatory nursery.
The child begins with compulsory phase or mandatory teaching.
Around the age of 6 or 7 the child starts first grade, which is the elementary school
All right.
Of course, the education is compulsory in Syria.
Back in the day it was compulsory from the first grade till the ninth grade
Then it changed and became compulsory from 1st grade till the grade of baccalaureat, which is the end of the secondary education.
Of course, children start going to school, as I said, from the age of 6 or 7
In primary school they study basic stuff, which is maths, Arabic language and a little bit of science, history and geography.
Those are the basics
All right.
Back in my days one could only choose English or French language
Classification or how one … for example every circa 2 months there was this thing called "small examination" or they would call it "revision"
It’s done during the two-month period, or month, according to the school or professor
They would examine the student on the stuff they had done during those 2 months.
Of course these marks have a little effect on the midterm exam, which comes after the first semester
But it’s not too critical
Critical would be the first examination, which finishes around the end of winter or the beginning of spring
All right?
Then there’s the second semester.
After the first semester there’s a rest, holiday for about a month or 2 weeks, it depends
Then there’s the second semester, and at the end of the second semester there’s another examination, which determines if the student’s going to pass to the next year or fails and stays in the same grade and repeats the following year
Elementary school begins from the first grade till the sixth grade
All right
Back in the days I remember schools had mixed-sex elementary schools.
However, after that, in middle school I think they separated the students.
According to what I remember, there were girls’ schools or girls’ attendance.
For instance, if the boys’ attendance was in the morning, then the girls’ attendance would be in the afternoon in that week.
The following week the girls’ attendance would be in the morning and the boys’ attendance would be in the afternoon
Of course, the students certainly take every exam, there is no other way but to take the exam.
If someone misses the exam, then they get mark zero
So, as I told you, each class had its own marking policy, I don’t remember it exactly
And exams were divided, I think maths exam was from 60 marks
Arabic exam was from 50 marks
Science exam was from about 30 or 40 marks, I don’t recall exactly
Physics and chemistry were from 7th grade till 9th grade, marks were from 20
All right?
I think English was maybe from 40, honestly, I don’t remember
Of course, the secondary education, as we were talking about in the beginning, is compulsory till 9th grade.
And in Syria, schools, there is no … they are for free
All right? One would not pay (for nursery school), only if the parents wanted their children to private schools.
Then, for sure, they would pay.
In the elementary school, according to what I recall, there were single-sex classes.
They were divided into boys’ school and girls’ school
Okay, here we have something missing, which is the secondary education
All right?
In the of the middle school... in the ninth grade
The exam of this grade, as they say, determines student’s future
Student’s future, meaning if he wants to study humanities. Those are humanities subjects
All right? Or if he wants to study science subjects, those are maths, physics, chemistry or science
At the end of the ninth grade there’s an exam.
There’s an acceptance rate of humanities or science studies
I don’t recall how many marks, but I think the minimum marks to being accepted in science studies is 200 out of 300
And if it was under 200 marks, then they would study humanities
Of course, if someone obtained more than 200 marks, they could study humanities.
It doesn’t mean that if they obtain more than 200 marks, they have to choose science studies. No.
All right?
That’s at the end of the ninth grade.
It’s very sensitive period, because the student is a teenager
And has to determine his future, so there’s pressure on him from his family to study, succeed, to comply with the secondary education, and not to fail the secondary education and not succeed in the school.
All right?
Then we have the secondary education, which is from 10th...11th grade and baccalaureate
All right?
If the student decides to study...or if his marks were enough to study humanities, then he would study subjects of humanities, those are poetry, Arabic, history and geography, all right,.. languages.
Or if he studies science field, then the focus will be more towards science subjects, maths, physics, chemistry and science
All right?
It’s for him to qualify for the university, for if the student chose the field of humanities, as they say, once he enters the university, he cannot go on to study maths, or physics, or engineering.
He would study for example Arabic, English or French literature, or law
All right, the one of advocacy, this is the humanities.
Science field is engineering, maths, medicine and these kinds of things
All right?
All right. In 10th 11th grade, as we said, the study is … is a bit intensive
All right? It is so the student can qualify to enter the last year of secondary education, that would determine his future, and if he’s going to university or not
All right?
The baccalaureate exam is also a very difficult exam, because it determines student’s future, if he’s going to be accepted to university or not
The exam system is the same as the elementary one
All right?
There would be one or two revisions during the semester then there’s the first semester exam.
Then in the second semester there are also two revisions and an exam, except for the baccalaureate grade, pardon, except for the baccalaureate year, which is the final exam
Which is the examination.
Before this exam, there is like a month so that the student prepares for it and studies all subjects so that he can obtain marks and enter the university
If the baccalaureate student didn’t obtain enough marks to enter the university.
The universities set a minimal average of marks for a student enters the branch that he wants
All right?
Baccalaureate exam is also very difficult.
So this time of the month after the school finishes, they do the first revision, then the second revision in the second semester
All right?
They would have around a month to prepare for the final exam of the secondary school phase
This exam is very difficult, especially at the scientific level, because they have studied many things and many things are difficult and complicated in physics, maths and science
They would be under enormous pressure from their parents, because they began with primary education to get to the level of baccalaureate.
So if they failed, they may not enter the university
Or sometimes if the student fails the baccalaureate exam, he’s obliged to repeat the year.
Or sometimes they don’t repeat the year, they would say: that’s enough, we don’t want to enter the university anymore
Let’s move on to university, okay (?)
The university, as we were saying, there’s the baccalaureate exam, which is intended for the student if he chose humanities.
And also for every branch there is a minimal limit and if the student gets these marks during the baccalaureate exam, he has the right to enter the university based on that, also on the science branch
Of course there’s nothing called “entrance exam“.
It depends on the marks. There is of course bribery
But I haven’t seen or heard of such thing.
Sorry, I meant I haven’t seen such thing, but I’ve heard that there’s such thing
Of course the university is mixed, it’s not single-sex
That male and female students enter the university together.
Of course, the length depends on each branch, now the humanities branches are generally for 4 years
After 4 years one graduates and gets an bachelor degree
Science disciplines are different of course.
The minimum years of study I think is 4, but I think for doctors it’s 7, for pharmacists 5 or 6, and for engineers in general 5 years
I think physics and chemistry is for 4 or 5 years, I’m not exactly sure
Of course it’s free. One is not obliged to pay money
Recently there has been an adjustment for the process of entering the university
For example, let us say, if we talk about English literature, the request was 200 marks as a minimum for entering the English literature.
There are students who for instance obtained 198, 195 marks or something like that, so they made something called “parallel education“
Parallel education is when you want … the student wants 2 or 5 marks to enter the division, because he couldn’t.
So the state did this thing – OK, you pay money and we give you these marks, so you qualify for entering the branch.
These money are paid every year until his education is finished.
Okay?
Of course there are possibilities for someone to study abroad.
I think it’s after the second year, it depends on the agreement between the universities.
Between the universities that are for example present in Syria and in Europe or in America or any country in the world.
So they say it depends on the agreement between both universities.
For example, after the second year the university sees who got the highest average score for the two years
Then they pick two, three or five out of them, it depends on the agreement between the universities.
These students then get to study abroad.
Of course it’s not the same as “Erasmus“, as I said, it’s an agreement between the universities.
They go, study and finish their study.
Then they return to the their university and work as a assistants or they adapt like in case the student wants to choose to finish his studies or wants to change the field, wants another field.
Of course the young generation, which is my generation, for sure most of them that I know studied.
There are a few people who didn't study, or didn't finish their baccalaureate, so they worked.
All right?
But most people I know from my circles, they studied at a university and finished their studies.
The best university in Syria are in the first place is al-Sham Private University, or the University of Damascus, then there is the University of Aleppo.
No, students do not have any discount to museums or public transportation, never, they are like ordinary people
For religious school, I think that I don’t have much information about them.
But from the information I know religious school is also single-sex, boys and girls
It begins from the primary school till the secondary education
Its specialization would be humanities.
They would study humanities subjects, in addition to religious subjects
Of course the attendance is single-sex, there’s girls’ attendance and boys’ attendance
Then the baccalaureate exam for religious schools is the same baccalaureate exam for the secondary education, in addition to other subjects, that are studied in religious schools
For example, there are normally 7 subjects
Religious schools have more.
They have approximately 12 or 13 because they study various religious subjects
All right?
I think it’s more difficult than the usual phase, than the usual secondary education
Those who pass the exam would be on the same level as the students who studied humanities studies
All right?
Unless they want to go on to study higher studies or to study in one of the universities of sharia, those are religious universities, as they say
I think that’s all I have for now, that’s what I remember
Thank you
Then again I stayed in the second company for some time
And then I moved to a third company
There it was very good for me
I was even promoted to a higher position, okay
And I started to give, the things that I had learned, I was teaching them to the new people who were coming to the company
And the manager, my manager used to rely on me a lot, in things that… my colleagues didn't know how to solve them
So he used to come to me, or even some rather complicated things, so he used to come to me, so that we could solve it
Alright, I gained a lot of experience in this company
After that, I have moved to a third company now, again a better one but in a different field
It’s going fine now... it’s fine, but with coronavirus, one is working from home
So the situation isn’t very... isn’t very... comfortable, but it’s better than others
Fortunatelly I have an office job
It’s better than for example If I worked in a restaurant or any other place which would require me to be there, I could have lost my work
So this is one of the pros it has, that I have an office job. Okay?
The level wasn’t sufficient.
Because when the lecturer is talking with... for example when he is delivering a lecture, he considers all the present people French and fluent in French.
So even... considering that we take for example notes or are writing in French (?), one would use abbreviations to make the writing easier.
Or even the speed in writing on the laptop, I mean a portable computer, there’s speed, and I don’t have this (kind of) speed.
So regarding taking notes and stuff, I had difficulties, even understanding quickly, and rephrasing the sentences according to what I understood.
It requires an effort, one would have to be for example French, so he can instantly capture the idea and rephrase it, according to what he understood. It was a bit difficult.
When it comes to age, every pupil, students,
I only finished the first semester and I passed around 5 subjects out of 14, but I saw that it was a long and difficult journey
In order to become competitive with someone French, and there’s difficulty, because a French at that age has a CV or curriculum, full of experiences and so on.
So when it comes to applying for a job, of course those are preferred.
Because they have experience...and I’m new to this country, I have no experience regarding France, and they take this into consideration.
Experiences from before that I had, for example the job I had in Syria is not significant for French people like anything I did here in France.
So here I followed this idea.. So I decided that I need to find job and this job will make me sort of independent.
So as I’m still living with my sister, I will do my best to become independent, to live on my own.
Unfortunately, the French government, regarding asylum, they have deficiency in these kinds of things.
For example, regarding the refugee, if they could find him a place, accommodation...it’s not available.
The only solution is to find a job and to become independent, in order to pay the rent, and the rent here is very expensive.
So of course, there are many difficulties in France, when it comes to language or culture of a country, which is different from the one that is far from it.
Hello, my name is Maxim and I am 40 years old from Halab, Syria
I grew up in a family of six people
My father and my mother and we are four brothers, two brothers and two sisters
My big brother Johnny, Claudia, Kristen and I was the youngest one
I studied in a private school called The Brotherhood Institute
And this school was established by the French people when Syria was under the French mandate
And this school has remained until now
Anyway, this private school was teaching English from the preparatory level, that is the kindergarten
So, as my father was a mechanical engineer, he had knowledge of the English language
He was proficient in English
In addition to the Russian language because of his work in the oil fields
For Russian experts were coming and he was collaborating with them
And he went to Russia for a while, so he mastered the Russian language, too
Anyway, after the elementary stage, my father liked to move to another area, I mean one that would be far from pollution and far from inside the city, rush and like this
So, he chose Al-Hamdaniya
Al-Hamadaniya is a high area located within the city, of course
It was inhabited by like Russian officers and experts
It was a new quarter, I mean, it was beautiful
So here, I moved on to a new stage
Here, there was another school, new residents
I mean, a completely different quarter from the one I used to live in
So, I studied a middle school at Al- Hamadaniya Mixed School, since this school is a mixed school, that is how it's called, there are boys and girls
Here, the important thing is that for...
Religion, for example, for us, was a basic subject taught in the school
And here, given that the majority was not, I mean, it was not Christians in Hamadaniya
So sometimes, some teacher was absent, so, we used to attend as listeners in Islamic religion lessons. I mean, as a listeners, we were forbidden to participate, but we attended, like that
I became somewhat familiar with the Islamic religion
Hi Natalia, I hope you are fine!
Yeah, you wanted to ask me some questions today
I will happily answer them to you
So, one of your first questions was
Mmmm, how did I decide to study in Czechia?
Of course, this question was on my mind, especially when I was in high school in the twelfth grade
Mmm, I kept thinking that, firstly, I was hesitant between medicine and engineering
And, honestly, I didn't want to leave my country unless it was for the sake of medicine
Ok, and luckily, I hade a friend at school, he was also thinking to go and study in Czechia.
So, he planted the idea in my mind, like what do you think about studying at Charles University
Its rating is excellent around the world, it’s roughly from the best two hundred to three hundred universities
So I said “really!?”
I started to search and search and really, I found an office in the Emirates that could help me go abroad
So, they are manage all my documents and complete all my legal procedures, in order to … that I’m ready to travel.
So yes, regarding the visa, and regarding the university as well
And, anyway, of course, I am the second oldest boy, meaning I have a brother who is older than me
And my brother, didn't go abroad, in fact.
For real it was a hard decision, meaning that it was a little diffucult for my family, especially for my mother
Because I am far away from... especially since we, you know, how … even a total difference from our customs and traditions
From the Arab countries, it is not the same thing
So we encouraged each other to do this step
Yeah, fortunately, until this time I don’t regret.
So, about housing, of course, it was very difficult for me, because I am like most young people at this period.
Frankly, unfortunately, there is bigger dependence on our parents, while we attend school.
I mean, until the age of eighteen, unfortunately, all the procedures were done by my father
I did not have this experience
Fortunately there was a girl we knew, from our friends here in the Emirates
And, she was around two or three years in Czechia
She helped me with the basic procedures for the country, for example, the accommodation.
Yeah accommodation and the phone line
Yeah, I mean, where I should go, where I should arrive etc.
So it was made a bit easier.
Of course, one is afraid, and like this it becomes easier, I mean
Yeah, regarding Czechia, Czechia is, frankly, a very beautiful country
But I’m here, I mean I came here for one purpose, which is to study.
My activities in general are not many
So yes, I mean, my obligations here are mostly to try to focus on my studies, honestly.
On the weekends, I can go out with my friends
We can do some activities, go to the gym, go swimming, we go, I mean, to play football for example.
Yeah, like that, regarding yeah of course, one of the questions that also my parents still keep asking me
How is the language going with you? How... I hope that you’ve learned it? Especially since I’ve been for about four years here
But unfortunately, given the pressure of studying medicine, and given that we study in English
So I still don't find time for studying the language easily
Of course, I'm trying to study it, on the side, so I'm starting to get a little better
And specially because when we are in the hospital we need to use it, because many times there are patients who don’t know the English language
So we must try, I mean, we learn the language from the university.
We have courses at the university, called Medical Check.
And I am trying by myself to learn the general, I mean the normal Czech that we use on the street.
Through the internet, for example, Duo Lingo, and some other websites, and books and like that.
Yeah, fortunately we are young, so we rarely get sick
But in case we fall ill... I orginally came, I mean, it was one of the procedures that I hade to do, that I should get a health insurance.
As soon as I got a health insurance, it’s alright, I mean, I simply can go to any hospital, the insurance covers it
So then they call the they call the health insurance company, and they should know among themselves that I am covered and that’s it.
And that's it
After I got the decision for a year, I moved to an integration centre, I don’t know how to say “integration centre” in Arabic
In that integration centre they gave each of us like... a separate house inside a compound.
There were approximately... it had two or three floors, I don’t remember exactly
And within the... The Czech government was giving four hundred hours for free so that one could learn Czech language
In addition to the social support... which was, I think, three thousand four hundred and ten crowns every month, alright
And the rent was free from... the rent was free from the government
But... one was, for me, I said no, I don’t want, I don’t want to stay on the government support, okay
So I found a job in a kebab, a kebab restaurant
Just so that I didn’t have to stay in the... in this centre
But there was a... negative point that I could not learn the language, or I could not go to the language lessons, okay
So I went to Morava, there was a person who offered me a job
I went there to Morava, I worked for about... six or seven months, saved some money, okay
And then... I decided, no, I didn’t come here to Czechia to work in a kebab restaurant, I am an university graduate so... this was just a temporary thing for me until I would find something better
Okay, then I moved to Prague, of course, I didn’t know anybody in Prague, I started all over from zero on my own
I worked in a hostel at first, I was living in the hostel, I had stayed there for about... a month until I found my own place
Then, the contract with the... the hostel was for a part time job
Then I found a job in a company... an American company, they wanted as they say a shared services centre
And they hired me as an accountant, I had some experience with it from when I had been working in Syria
Okay, then I made... some friends here, okay, with time one gains more experience and searches for something more, or something better, alright
I had been working in this company for a year and a half approximately, after a year and a half I found a better company, I moved there... okay
Well, the first thing that crossed my mind is a question
Go ahead.
I know the answer, but those who will listen to this recording don't know it.
Okay, sure, they’ll find out.
Tell me, you came to the Czech Republic, how many years have you been here?
I came to Czechia in 2017. To be accurate, in February.
I remember this day, it's impossible to forget.
I came from a Mediterranean country where the average temperature reaches zero at its lowest, you know right?
Yes, right.
I mean, you know, we don’t have a lot..
Let’s say that our winter isn’t frosty.
I mean sometimes it falls to one or minus one below zero.
So, I came in February, you could probably say that in our area it was the beginning of spring.
So, I got off the plane, Natalie,
And I don’t have to tell you, as you know, that here on the first of February everything is white.
As I’m getting off the plane, the first thing is fog
I got to the airport and everything around me is white. It was the first time that I saw such an amount of snow, first time in my life.
So you took a strong hit when you first got off.
Yes, what can I tell you, let’s say that I was hit by severe depression yeah
I said where the heck have I arrived, however, this was the first day of five years.
Essentially, I mean, I have been here for five and a half years, probably five years and three or four months, yeah.
And the temperature fell, what can I tell you, it was minus seven, minus eight and I´ve never seen that.
I left the airport, I wanted to take an inland bus,
The snow was probably fifty centimeters, it reached to my knees, so what’s that!
Of course, this was the beginning of the trip, so this was the first impression you know.
I understand.
It gives you that, it gives you the expectation, that there is something tough awaiting you, okay.
I came here with the goal to work here and finish my studies
One of the first experiences I went through was my experience with the Czech language school.
Of course, in my opinion, the best thing for someone to fit in a country is to learn its language, hundred percent, right?
Exactly, I agree with you on this.
Yeah, hundred percent, what do you think?
So, this was the first thing I did, before I came to the Czech Republic I enrolled in a Czech language school, a course for about six months.
Frankly, the teacher was very very lovely, her name was Jarka, right?
Jarka - I really don’t know, but yes, there is a name Jarka.
Sure, but I mean that’s a very traditional Czech name, Jarka.
Yes, yes, a traditional Czech name
I still remember this woman from five years ago,
Of course, she was probably in her sixties, she was very lovely
And she embraced us more than just students.
Nice.
Yeah, so I started to learn the Czech language.
Of course, at first, I was very pleased with the areas of life available here
Yeah, then I tried to get to know people, at first I went to the bar
I mean the school, that I was in, was all foreigners
There weren’t Czechs, except the teachers
Then I tried to go to the bar, to get to know people
Of course, I got to know mostly foreigners
Because I was speaking more English than Czech.
Then when I developed my Czech, I started to feel the difference in general
I’m not talking specifically about the Czechs
But the difference in impressions between the people from the Middle East and the Europeans.
You know we.. I don’t know if you’ll agree with my opinion
Let’s agree on the expression... we are more... I don’t want to say that we are more friendly people.
No, the Europeans are very friendly, but we are, I don’t know, familiar, let's say or..
Familiar or.., I would say more affectionate or friendy
We have tenderness, let me tell you, it’s in everything, not only in the positive, but also in the negative.
I mean, let’s say our impressions or reactions are really strong,
Meaning when we are happy, we get very excited right
Right, when we are upset, we get very upset
We get happy … we get very upset
This might be one of the things, let’s say that we can’t control our feelings like Europeans.
This thing is probably what I felt, among the differences that I felt
And, for example, we are very open in terms of...
What I mean, for instance, if I got to know someone in my country, it would probably take two or three days for me to invite him over, right?
Right, right, but here it’s a little difficult.
Here it can be difficult.
I think that it’s a bit difficult because the people themselves...
For example, they have, let me shorten it in one sentence, many people protect their privacy.
Yes, right.
This is one of the reasons that make them react this way to a stranger.
Or even to a member of the extended family.
Right, exactly, I felt this
I’ll tell you my experience with a friend from my first work, where I used to work
I mean, we were at work and so on, I remember it was a Friday.
And there was somebody, her cousin, imagine, it was her cousin visiting her from another Czech city,
Of course this girl works in Prague.
I remember her name was.. Lucy. That was it... Lucy
Yeah
So, her cousin came
Of course, she had space there at her house,
And she was living, if I remember correctly, she was living with someone.
But there was a place, okay
Now, I said, for example, if there is somebody coming to visit me
For sure you’ll let him stay at your house.
For sure I would accommodate him, I would let him sleep at my house.
Then really, after a while a friend of mine came
He was living in Portugal
So, he came to my place for four days, I was still in the dormitory, you know
I mean, there was a foldaway bed, so, it’s normal, that I accommodated him.
And as I said, her cousin, allegedly to protect their privacy
She booked a hotel, she didn’t stay with her.
So, this is the thing that felt strange to me.
Yes, it’s strange
It’s strange but over time, for example, if you’re living in Czechia or you’re in contact with the people, at the same time you understand them
But you yourself can’t do what they decide
Frankly, I do agree and do not.
In my opinion, it is a very important thing to protect your privacy.
And by the time I really understood it, because when you sometimes take from your privacy, you’re consuming your own space.
You’re not automatically forced to accommodate people who take up your space
While really the idea that they have their privacy is also an important thing.
I mean, often if you invite someone to stay with you
he’ll be embarassed and tell you yes even though he doesn’t want to, you know.
This is one of the problems we have, we’re not very straightforward, we have a lot of …
So, this privacy matter is one of the things, one of the problems, that I faced. The thing anout privacy...
Right.
I mean, let’s say you want to stop by Tesco
You try to talk to them in English, see how they’ll react
And if you talk to the same person in Czech, their reaction will be very different, right?
Let me tell you, why it will be different
Most of the people living here in Czechia, I’m not saying, that they don’t learn English in school, of course they do.
Uhm
But most people who work, for example, in big stores, that people need to go to daily
It’s very hard to find someone speaking English
So, the only way to communicate with them is in Czech
It´s Czech
Another thing, it is surely a natural thing that exists in the human’s nature
When a person speaks the same language as you do, surely he’ll be more comfortable, than speaking to a stranger.
Right, maybe..
But this bothers me, it should be English.
So that even the stranger can get the same service as others
Yes, right, firstly I would say that it is different because the daily understanding is in Czech as you said
Secondly the ability to help is better, meaning people can help you more in their mother language
But do you think this should reflect in...
I’m not talking about the ability to help, I mean the ability to react, to response
In your opinion, does it always have to be a negative reaction?
Because there are people, who, let’s say, react negative towards speakers of a foreign language.
Yes, I understand, I mean, if I understood correctly, you feel a form of racism
Yes, relatively. I’m not saying against a certain nationality, no.
I speak against foreigners in general, who don’t speak Czech.
As I told you, if you speak Czech, the terms change for you.
I have had experiences and it seem that you too... For example, you speak Czech, I don’t know, let’s say for a percentage of seventy or eighty, maybe ninety, right?
Yes, we could say about eighty, eighty five percent.
In your opinion, does this, for example, allow you to build a better social life with people of the Czech origin
Honestly, yes.
When I came here at first, as I told you, I have been here in the Czech Republic for two and a half years and the beginning was very difficult.
Also, I wasn’t able to be in touch with people
The person I was in touch with the most was my mother.
Okay, sure, of course.
I mean she isn’t “people”, but because she was the most understanding and my Czech wasn’t good, but I improved it.
And by time as I improved it, I felt I gained favor with people
For example, I started to be able to express my feelings better.
People started to accept me better.
Because they understood me and I understood them.
During the time I lived here and according to the opinions that I heard
I felt that, for example, people will view you as a stranger, who decided to live here
They’ll say that you live by the same standards as we do, in the same land as we do
So why wouldn’t you learn the same language that we learned.
Of course, hundred percent
But I’ll move to another topic, it’s different, but of course it originated from the language theme, so let’s move on to it.
For you to gain the trust and love of people, you must also have the knowledge not only in the language as I said
Which is the entrance to another important thing and that is the culture.
That’s the folk, I mean, in order for you to understand their theater, to get their jokes, let’s say their sense of humor
Or to understand the kind of music they like, you have to understand their language.
I think that is one of the barriers, that’ll hold you back, you want to understand..
In order to fit in their society, you have to like and know their culture,
But to know their culture you must have the first entryway which is the language
Right
You know
In my opinion the culture topic is very important and let me tell you, you won’t fit in without the knowledge or high knowledge of the language
Correct, I think your situation is a little different than mine
Because you don’t have any relatives here in the Czech Republic, correct?
I have a cousin, but unfortunately he isn’t Czech, and he also he didn’t move here very long ago
He’s been living here for about eight years, I mean, his language is better than mine, but not completely
And let’s say another important thing, one of the keys, to get into the culture, to engage with the Czech culture, is to have a Czech friend.
I wasn’t lucky in this, until know, of course, I don’t know
You can consider me as half Czech
Ha-ha, okay, done, I will take this into consideration, thank you Natalia for the offer
In my opinion it is important, to find a Czech person who will introduce you to the subject
Correct
Very very important
That way he gets you in the subject without noticing, that you’re kind of integrating, or not integrating.
We could say that you understand, or see the subject from a different angle
From the angle of somebody local, from inside, that’s for sure, hundred percent
From my point of view, after five years in the Czech Republic, I see the Czechs from outside, to see them form inside you need that person.
Correct
That’s my personal opinion
Correct, I agree
A question that crossed my mind
What’s the worst thing that happened to you here in the Czech Republic, in terms of dealing with something, or for example, a thing that you wanted to solve or documents that you needed
What bothered you the most or made you think why that happened.
I swear, as I told you, firstly, I can’t blame someone in particular, I blame it on the fact, that I don’t understand very well,
But sometimes these things are connected to a topic, for example, the topic of language.
For example, a while ago, not too far, maybe four or five months, I was in a bar playing billiard
There was a person, I think he was Czech, because he was speaking Czech.
I was there with a Syrian friend of mine, we were speaking Arabic.
So, he saw us from far
I mean the guy I was with is darker than me
Meaning his skin is a little dark
We were speaking a strange language.
He started telling us.. I mean, he was looking at us and he was drunk, of course, I can’t blame him too much, he had a background
So, he was looking at us and told us: „mate bomba, mate bomba“,
Which in Czech means do you have a bomb, this thing bothers me a lot, you know.
Of course, he was drunk, I mean I didn’t want to talk to him, because he was drunk, but it bothers me for real.
Because he’s not.. not conscious.
No, he wasn’t conscious, but it gives a bad impression.
So this is one of the things.
Correct, in this matter I like to blame, not that I like to blame, I think I’d blame the stereotyping of the Arab society in general through its portrayal in media
Correct, I agree with this opinion for sure. Unfortunately, the Arab media aren’t able to convey a nice image of Arabs.
I’m not saying that we are a nation of angels, but we have a lot of very positive things, that the media aren’t showing.
Exactly
Unfortunately, the media outline negative things
That we are the third world, we have poverty, that we have bloodshed and desctruction
And that because of this bloodshed and destruction many of us behave violently.
No way, this thing is very very wrong.
Of course, at the end it leads to generalization, and why the generalization
The generalization is caused by the view of the western media, which is more..
I’m not saying, that all western media is bad, but that the most prevalent western media gives a bad impression
And the people.. There are many people who don’t look up the details
They hear the first two sentences, okay, there are problems with the Arabs and they have a lot of crimes
So, they must be a bad nation, you know.
Correct
But no, why? Go on and search for the details and you’ll find that we have many things,
The first musical language, the first musical notes were written in the Arab world
The first astronomists were from the Arab world
The first alphabet was from the Arab world
So, I mean, sometime in history, of course, let’s say in the Middle Ages, we were..
It’s said that the Arab world was the beacon of civilisation.
There was a time when Europe was flooded with ignorance and darkness, right?
And we were the ones who published, for example, in the days of Al-Andalus, there was I mean, the level of education was very high.
Of course, this changed over time, it’s not the same, there are other nations that occupy the first ranks in education.
But we have our history, that means the generalization is wrong, this is what I wanted to get to at the end
That the generalization is very very wrong, one mustn’t generalize, in all societies there is the good and the bad
I agree with you, in everything you said.
That’s it
Let’s reverse the question a little, tell me what is the thing that you liked the most here in the Czech Republic
For example, in terms of culture, Czech customs that you liked or did you like, for example, walking on his way
I swear, what I like very much about the Czech people is that their ability to separate work from their free time
They are very distinguished at it, they enjoy their life
I mean, for example, in Prague the ease of life, the ease of enjoying life
Whatever you want is available, theater, music, coffee shops, cinemas, there are many things for one to participate in..
There are places you can entertain yourself even if you’re not a Czech speaker, there are many things for foreigners
I don’t speak at all, no, even if you’re a foreigner, with English
you can engage in life naturally and that’s what I do
Because of my, let’s say, little knowledge of the Czech language
I gain most of my cultural acquisitions through the English language and I think this is widely available here
Yeah, I’ll ask you a last question, I’ll ask you a last question and we shall wrap it up.
Uhm
How did you manage to find a house here in the Czech Republic,
Because I often hear that it’s very difficult to find a place, especially here in Prague, close to the city center
Yeah difficult, I swear, look.. maybe I was lucky with this, because, I mean, I have one kind of experience with the topic of housing.
But I also had some of my friends, of course Syrians, Arabs and foreigners, tell me a different thing when they were looking for a house here. So maybe I was lucky.
I searched on one of the Czech sites, its very Czech, it’s called “bez realitky”, surely you know it.
And of course, as I told you, my friends said they talk only Czech there and so on. I talked to someone and he spoke to me in English.
And some of them told me, I mean my friends, that some people take only Czechs
I told him I’m a foreigner from the third world countries, this guy was..
And this goes back to what I said earlier, that not everybody is the same and generalization is wrong.
Exactly
The guy, owner of the house that I’m renting, is a very lovely, nice guy and understanding towards foreigners.
It was a weird thing, as I told you, maybe I was lucky, I don’t know
He is lucky and we are lucky that we were able to record this voice recording
Thank you very much Natalia
I wish you a very nice day a thank you so so much Wasim
Thank you so much and thanks to Adam and I’m very pleased to be here with you.
Bye
Hello, my name is Majd, from Syria from the city of Latakia.
My childhood, when I remember it, was simple without the complications that we are now living through.
I studied at a school called Nabil Halloum,
After I finished school, I went to university, the Tishreen University.
I studied English literature, I graduated from it.
Ok, interests, it's ball games for example, swimming...
Sometimes in leisure time, for example, in summer, we used to go out to the village to my grandfather's place, or even, for example, when we went I would meet my friends.
Life here in general is good.
Good that I can't say anything bad at all, alright.
Most of the problems or most of the problems that I face here are language problems.
When I want to go to a government office, for example, or to whichever institution, it is necessary to have someone with me who speaks English or Czech so that I am able to communicate with the employees.
The work here, I never had any problems finding a job.
The job opportunities are available here and in abundance.
Hi Wasim one more time, how are you?ا
Hello Natalia I am fine good, because its a nice sunny shine day, so the mood must be perfect with this weather with the beginning of summer, are you good?
Yeah good, and I agree with you
So that’s great thanks good.
And tell me what did you have for lunch today, something tasty?
See, today I ate one of my favorite meals, which you can find a lot in our country, especially in the region where I am, which is seafood.
Mmmm I ate a meal, the well-known name by the foreigners is calamari, we call it sabidi, which in standard Arabic is sabidij.
There was a restaurant having a discount of forty percent on Bolt, so I saw it and I said, “Hey, this is your chance boy”
It is generally a little bit expensive, so the meal at that place is almost two hundred and sixty crowns, so he had sale forty percent, so it cost some one hundred and sixty crowns.
So I took a Sabidij, and I took it with baked potatoes, it was surrounded, and some grilled vegetables
Nice, hope that you enjoyed it
Thank you, my dear, thank you so much. It was so delicious.
Nice, and since you are in Czechia, I have such a question, for example, what is the best Czech food you like?
A very nice question, yes, mmmm, I can tell you or I can answer you very quickly because in general, according to what I saw, the Czech cuisine is not that much rich, ok.
So we agreed that it is possible in a quick period that you can do the full experience
Or you can do a quick round, let's say to all the Czech food
So let me say the most delicious meal I love in the Czech cuisine is svíčková ok
And there is something else that I like, and I like it because I could do it by myself, for generally I like cooking, too
This is a thing that you should know about it. I think you know, for sure right?
Of course yes
So, it is a soup. The name of the soup is kulajda. I love kulajda so much, and I can cook it very well
This soup is very delicious, and these two meals in my opinion are the best in Czech cuisine
So we agreed that it is possible in a quick period that you can do the full experience
They also rely on meat and meats that contain fat, like sausages and like that, and for me its not my favorite
I love things that are light in fat
So that’s it
You tell me, what did you eat today? You keep asking me!
Today I ate with my roommate risotto
Nice Italian risotto
We cooked it … it was really good, and yesterday I cooked mjaddara
Ohhh what a wonderfull mjaddara, I need to tell you about mjaddara
It was about us, while I worked in Amazon, so in the company that I work for, they were working in the last days of Ramadan, they made iftar.
Thay made event, let me say, I mean they made event, let us say it in Arabic
They were doing an event where they brought some food or they asked the people who wanted to participate to bring some food
So I brought the things and foods that seemed to me that I like, that are my favourite
And what can go with preparation ahead of time, of course, if you want to do something with meat, it needs its time, right?
Right.
So, one of the things that you can cook a day before and that will remain good the next day is mjaddara
So I cooked it and it will be popular and liked why?
Because it is vegetarian, in the end, right! For example, mjaddara is one of the foods that I think are easy to take with you. Now, I am adding a promotion idea to the recording.
I think that among the things you might invest into here in Czechia is mujaddara
Because it is very rich in terms of the nutrients in it, there is a lot of nutrients in it.
I mean, there are proteins, carbohydrates and good vitamins
So I think its a very good idea
What else did I do, can you guess? Guess!
What?
Hahahha ok, I made hummus, hummus as we call it, which is in Czechia and all of Europe known as hummus
Yeah, I did it and I added the secret ingredient to the Arabic recipe, which is the cumin
Because the foregin cumin is not the same at all as Arabic cumin, there is a difference, you know that right?
Surely yes!
There is a big difference in the food, a big difference, so I used the Arabic cumin, and it was very very good
And it was appreciated a lot, almost unnaturally, all the people started to call it nice names
And everybody wants to have orders from me
Of course, because you are very involved in cooking, it means that people are happy
Yeah, yes, I swear, they were very happy, and what did I do, can you guess? This still not every thing.
I made grape leaves
Ohhh, Dawali
Dawali, dawala leaves, grape leaves that we wrap
I made it, but what I did, we call it by the Levantine name, we call it Yalanji.
The Yalanji is the one, I don’t know what you call it in Palestinian
I think we also use the name Yalanji
The Yalanji is the one without meat, it will be a veggie. I mean, I put just rice with some special spices mixture of mine
And with some vegetables, we put also tomato, onion, with some parsley and mint, pomegranate molasses and like that and the seven spices
It was very, very delicious.
Of course this in the Arabic cuisine is one of the meals, let's say, that if someone likes someone then he makes it for him.
You know that the Yalanji, because it is not only about the issue of ingredients, there is also the time
It takes a lot of preparation time
So you almost if you want to wrap a meal for three people. It will take you an hour just to wrap and cooking also takes one and a half or two hours
So this is what I did. Let's say that it was a great hit in the company
Of course because it was very delicious
Of course, definitely, sure, a hundred percent
So I swear I like it so much, yalanji is so delicious
Oh nice, they were so lucky! And what... what is your favorite Arabic meal?
Mmmm the Arabic food that I like best, guess?
I will try
Ok
Mombar?
Yeah it’s near. It´s hard to make and also there is a nice meat and usually its made in a festive period
And bulgur is there
Oh my sweetie I don't know
Ok its the kubbe
Ohh the kubbe! I don't know how I almost forgot about it, damn
Ok so you don´t like it?
I like it so much, i like it fried, but the best that I like is kubbe niyye
Ok great, kubbe niyye is number two for me, I love it so much, frankly
I love it so much and I love it especially when there are things around it, like vegetables, like onion or peppers, and parsley and mint.
And like that when you mix it with a fork, ohhhh
Exactly
Nothing is better than this
But the number one for me is the grilled kubbe that we grill on the coals. You fire the coal below it and make it almost as a round disc, you know how
I know
So this is the second meal.
So when you make it you prepare the kubbe whose shape is like a disc.
You make it in a form of two parts and the filling inside is meat, beef with onion and pine nuts and spices, and you cook it this way.
Of course, this is basic and many people like it with a bit of fat that they put inside the filling.
Yeah we do the same
The think that is the fat of lamb exlusively, and the meat of lamb
So you put it on a fire and the fat starts to comes out, of course, the peercentage of fat is five thousand percent, here it becomes
But it will be very tasty meal
Nice
Yeah
And about the kubbe with milk – do you like it?
Don´t ask me if I love it, I love all the kubbe, but the kubbe with sour milk, yes.
Yeah, I love it so much with sour milk, it is something else. But this is rather like a soup, right?
Exactly
You feel … sorry... it comes like this, a bit light compared with fat
And it …
What?
I was just saying that the kubbe with sour milk reminds me of Shushbarak, I don´t know why
Yes, it is absolutely correct. It is almost the same ingredients as the yogurt component. I don't know frankly. I like to cook, but the details of how to cook Shushbarak or the details of cooking the milk- yogurt kubbe, it´s new for me.
Let me stay in the basics, this is a complicated job, as you know
These things, these things even mothers don´t do, grandma generation do it or you say the old women
I mean, my grandma is the mother of my mom or mom my dad.
True
These people who make the kubbe, for us in general, because this thing needs you to prepare it day before.
Soak the bulgur, knead the dough, or relax it, and next day you do it again, it is a long story
I agree with you. Besides the Arabic cuisine, I think, you also like the Italian cuisine, right?
I swear that you got it, hundred percent. Yes, I love the Italian cuisine so much
About a month ago, I don't know if I told you, I won, we did competition in the company too, mmmm, Italian cooking
No, you didn´t tell me, tell me.
Now I will tell you about it
We agreed before one week, to start to cook Italian food and send the pictures of the food to the group on the network from the work
So there was a lot of competition, as there were Italians with us. I won with the pictures of food I prepared, I even won over the Italians
With... with spaghetti, with macaroni, as we call it, mmm, I was very good, very nice
Nice
I will show you the pictures after a while
Seriously, I will show you the pictures, I am not joking
So I made macaroni and I also made pizza, yes
And I won in the competition, of course, for I won in the competition. Sure, as I won, they gave me a voucher from Amazon, fifty euros. So I went to buy an oven, a special oven for pizza
Congratulations
And I developed the Pizza Napolitano, and for this word there is no translation, because is is Napolitano
So I made my dough and I got very close to the Napolitano Pizza
Also I will show you the pictures to prove that this is true
Nice, so congratulations. And about the Amazon, I remember that you told me that you were working there in Amazon, is that right?
Yeah I work in Amazon
So how do you find the work? Is it good? Are there problems?
It's nice, a bit of stress, you can say
It´s work, in general, I mean, I mean... All people I think, know that there is nothing special so that I can tell you
I mean they have a lot of privacy in dealing with the customer or the client
They love to see the customer being satisfied and right
They delivered their orders at a specific time, so it is fine, I am happy because everyone feels productive, so this job is important.
Nice
Yeah of course
Of course Amazon is not the first work that I worked in, but, you know from my experience in Czech Republic, mmmm, i think, yeah that the company that is international.
Like with the international company, one feels more comfortable for there are multiple nationalities present there
This thing is very positive for me
Yeah I understand and agree with you
Sure?
Sure
Sure you feel more like... for I was working in a Czech company before, so you feel that you are for example like stranger, you are not integrated
Once it is an international company, you feel that there are people from different nationalities, one feels that they share your feelings, you are not the only stranger in this country, and people let you feel that you are integrated with them
True, abut this we will talk in the next recording
ok sure
now we thank you so much
thanks
For the beautiful things that you tell us about it and about the good food
Thank you, you make us hungry, now Natalia we must start cooking after the recording
We must go, which means, we are done!
The education system in Syria is like the French education system
It is free of charge in all stages of study, except the stages … the private schools.
The education stages are as follows:
The basic education stage and this stage is compulsory.
After that, the middle school stage,
which is supposed to determine the path of the student. It is three fields, either the general one, or industry and trade or communications.
After that, there is the secondary stage
Which starts from the tenth grade, in which the student studies all the subjects
Scientific subjects, physics, chemistry, mathematics
And humanities like history, geography, philosophy etc.
After that, the student can choose the field which he wants to continue in.
Either humainties or science, and finally he passes the baccalaureate
Which roughly determines the future of the student
Because based on the total, he continues the studies, whether in institutes or at universities.
Of course, at the university there are libraries in which there are resources and books for those who want to do any kind of research.
Or a PhD thesis within a specific specialisation.
And the first ones have priority in applying for a scholarship
To complete the specialization in a European country after studying the language for a year or more.
Regarding the asylum interview, now, here, based on my experience, here in Czechia there’s no asylum, okay
It exists legally, but based on what I know, it is not given to anyone
Here, in most of the... most of the... cases they are given international protection, okay
International protection for one year at first, then, that’s based on my own experience, then it’s renewed for two years, after two years it’s renewed for another two years.
Okay, the questions were very very detailed at the... at the... at the asylum interview
There was an Arab interpreter, a female interpreter, from the same city as me, I think
Okay, and... I was able to do the interview in English, they told me no, you have to do it in... in your mother tongue Arabic
There were many detailed questions, for example my exact address, name of the owner of the place, or the grocery shop which is in my neighborhood, okay, names of... my relatives, my (paternal) aunt’s husband, my (maternal) aunt’s husband, names of their children and what they do for a living
It was quite intense, honestly
For example I forgot name of husband, my maternal aunt’s husband or my paternal aunt’s husband, I don’t... I only know his first name, I don’t know his second name. Okay.
There was persecution during... during the revolution, according to the available news.
Of course, this is Syria, very diverse in communities and religions
Alright, and most of the people are Sunnis, those rose up against the regime, who are Alawites
But this is not true in general, there are many people from other small communities who joined the revolution, because of the goal of the revolution.
They were oppressed by this regime and they wanted to get rid of it, alright
And in the beginning, the revolution was very, very peaceful, very peaceful, there were no weapons, nothing at all, alright.
Demonstrations were peaceful, but they were demanding freedom.
And the regime is able to handle this, okay and.. started to kill people, and... there was killing, there was blood
So the people also took up arms and then the things turned into a … a civil war
People from... from abroad, outside Syria, who are not Syrians, they were defending Syrians, and then the things were not there.
I think that... the revolution is still going on, for example... last month or some time ago there was ten years anniversary of the revolution.
So people went out again demaning the fall of the regime peacefully again.
Okay, I have heard many stories, or there were many eye witnesses of, of... the horrors which were happening in, in prisons.
Something absolutely unbelievable, something unimaginable, or even one is not able to imagine that a human does this to another human being
Once again, hello Wasim.
Hello two times, three times and four times.
Now in this recording, we will talk a bit about your work in the Czech Republic, generally about your work in your life and your experience with it.
Okay, like my working experience let’s say.
Yes, it could be.
Suffering days at work, hahaha, okay then, well, I started working, now, let's just say, when I was young, or relatively young.
I think I was twenty years old, when I started working.
Of course, I was still attending university and started working at an offshore office.
The city I live in my country is at the seaside.
I’m so sorry that I’m interrupting you, can you tell us the name of the area.
Of course, yes, the area is called Tartous.
You can see it on Google in Syria. It’s a very nice coastal area.
Of course, maybe people get an idea of Syria as a desert or something like that, but on the contrary, it’s very green area.
The percentage of rain there is high.
And like even its climate during the four seasons, feels like summer, winter, spring, autumn, alright?
Nice
So yes, I miss the area, where I lived, we will see, hopefully maybe in the summer we will visit it.
Hopefully.
Hopefully, so yes, this is the area I’m from.
Let me tell you there’s a sea port facing the sea
You see, when there’s a sea, the area there is for trading, like every place in the world, when there’s waterfront.
First of all, it’s a place for exchanging culture and so on, which is important, because there are people from everywhere, not like hinterland, where there are the same people.
Unlike the coastal areas, you feel that there are plenty of people exchanging culture, because people come from all over the world and exchange goods.
So for this reason, I feel that this area is multicultural and more open, because there’s seaport.
But sure, let´s get back to the topic of work
As I told you, I worked at an offshore office, maritime agency.
So, when ships arrive from foreign countries, there should be someone to take care of them.
The name of the position would be like shipping agent, someone who would take care of these things.
So, I started doing this as I told you, when I was young, I worked there for like 6 or 7 years.
Until the situation in Syria started to get a bit unwell.
And the employment matter started, but of course the economic situation naturally affects this topic.
So, I thought one should try new experience.
To move to another place.
So, as they say colloquially, one chases its income, right?
Yes, you’re right.
Okay, so then I moved to Czechia.
So I moved and first of all, I worked in a company, that was more or less Czech, I think.
The company is called..., let´s say it’s in the field of investment, equity investment
So, my work was, as I told you, in a company, Czech by character, but I worked in the area of the Middle East.
Our customers were from the Middle East, so I was talking to them about business relations
I would explain to them how they should invest in wall street and market, how the equity and stuff works.
Do you have any clue how equity and this kind of stuff works?
Honestly, I hear here and there about it, but of course, I’ve never entered the field, and it never crossed my mind to ask someone
Oh, okay, so these things are not like guaranteed.
There’s a risk or like danger, there is danger, but sometimes there are like investment stuff let’s say a shot
Investments can bring like a high rate of earnings
Or at least from what I remember, when I worked there in 2017.
From the stuff that I started working with, were new like Bitcoin, if you know Bitcoin, like digital currencies in general
Yes, of course
Yes, people who started investing, when it started, it was good for them
I worked in this company 8 months and then because of my studies.
Because when I came here, I enrolled in master's studies in Economy and Business Management.
So I couldn’t continue with the work, so I made some time for studying.
Then like I relaxed, if you want to say, for like 3-4 months.
Then I moved on and worked in the field of Tourism
In this field I worked in a hostel, because I wanted to have a part time job, not full-time.
Because as I told you, studying started to pressure on me
So I worked in a hostel, in a hotel, let’s say in a hotel, OK, a hotel.
So the advantages of working in a hotel are choosing your working schedule, time of the work, it’s flexible
So you can choose, sometimes you choose 3 hours of work, part of the shift, sometimes the whole shift full 12 hours, if you have a free day.
If you have a university day, you would work 4 hours
Or if you have for example university in the morning, you would work in the afternoon
Those are 4 hours
So you can keep balance of work and study
I worked at this hotel for like a year and a half, until the corona virus problem came
This hotel closed, it closed.
And I was working at that time on my master’s thesis.
So it kind of came at the right time
Like a lot, if it weren’t for the covid, I would have said that I wish the covid came, so I had the time for my thesis.
So I took the time for it, for like 4-5 months, and then like in the middle of the summer, when there was covid, I started working
I submitted applications, because I got my diploma, so I submitted application to an international company
And the characteristics of the company was different, because it had different nationalities and the management is more open to foreign people
And I like the topic of logistics or let’s just say logistics transportation, I like this field
And sure, I was in this field
Or I’m still around two years in this company
A very different experience when the company is international, when you have different people with different nationalities
You feel more like belonging somewhere, as I told you before
And I feel that in principle
Nice, and if you thought about a topic you have in mind, like work, what would you like to do in the future, far future?
Honestly in the far future the work I would do, like maybe for example...
Of course, everyone wants to establish a company, like private
Of course, I can work in this field, in logistics transportations and tourism, I feel that I think about this field in the future
But of course, one gets an experience first, and then once he has it, he has a bit of a capital, that he can start with...
So I think of these ideas, that are put forward
Nice, hopefully, it will be like that
Tomorrow we will make discounts, once we work in our tourism company and transportation
Yes, of course
Don’t tell them
In that case I think we will end this recording, and we will move on to another.
After my health deteriorated from the cold, I had to see a doctor
In order to find some doctor to examine me, I had to have identification papers
And since I was not an asylum seeker, I went with my sister to the hospital
We saw the person in charge of the department who gave permission to the employees to make a file for me so that I could be diagnosed and that I could get the necessary treatment after I explained her... after my sister explained her my case
Of course, these procedures took me time and my condition was worsening until I did not see the doctor
He prescribed me some pills and a healthy diet and that's how my condition slowly improved
After I studied at a school calledِ +
It was also in Hamadania, for boys only, there are no girls
For the baccalaureate is in Syria the thing that determines one´s future
Because based on the total that we get, that's what qualifies us to enroll in specialisations, in instiututes or universities
In the first year I didn't succeed, I failed in the baccalaureate
So then I studied at a private school. The Allepo private school.
And my total qualified me to enroll in a civil engineering institute
And also even within the institute there are +. There are specialisations of technical drawing, public construction, land surveyimg, environmental enegineering and transportation
So I enrolled in environmental engineering
My total qualified me to enroll in this specialization
And then I studied in the first year and I passed
And in the secom year there occurred an administrative problem
I mean, as to whether I should get an exam in one subject of the supplementary unit, or I should get an exam again in fourteen subjects.
It means all the subjects of the second year in addition to a subject of the first year.
Now they sent an inquiry to Damascus, the capital.
Regarding this matter
And the answer didn't come
So, the supplementary unit passed
And the new year started
And there was no response from, I mean, from the capital
So here, I left the institute
At the same time, the open education university was opened for the specialization of translation
Translation from English to Arabic
And here I studied, but it was in a different governorate, in the governorate of Homs.
Then, I used to travel by bus
Homs is two hours away from Aleppo
To attend the lectures and get back
But at the time of the exam, I was renting a house
This period at the university was very beautiful
I mean, as a special stage in my life, I spent nice days in it
Living in Homs was cheaper compared to Aleppo
I mean, Aleppo is considered one of the major cities in Syria. I mean, as a city, it is the lagest than the governorate of Damascus.
Now, Homs is a small city in the central region
So I studied and stayed there from 2001 to 2006, until I finished the university
I got a Bc. in translation
Then there is the issue of the nice souvenir area that is obligatory.
in 2007, I went to the army, I joined the army service, I mean, and I stayed ther until 2009, January 1 2009
But during this period, generally, I didn’t do anything.
Like dead time, I mean the time passed in vain, I don’t count it as a part of my life.
Two years passed like that
And after that there is no work in my field.
In fact, it’s not only about my case, this is the case of most young Syrians nowadays
He would study at the university and then he would go to do something else, depemding on what he gets or is available to him.
okay
Firstly, it started, the Arab Spring, as they say, in 2013, if I am not mistaken, in Tunisia.
Then it extended to the second countries.
At that time, when the First Spring arrived to Egypt,
People in Syria also started to demand the same thing for political reasons.
But the government or the current president now, has been there from the sixties.
And there was a security tightening, they prevented gatherings or anything like that,
So the people started to demand.. to go to demonstrations.
They just wanted freedom and social justice, and stuff like that
They didn't want at the beginning to change the regime, and nothing, okay.
In this period, I had already finished or was about to finish university.
After we finish the university, one must go to the military.
Ok, when ** after six months from the beginning of the revolution in Syria
There have been many things that were not good.
There started to be killings, torture and arbitrary arrests.
In Syria, we have compulsory military service that begins after the age of eighteen.
So for the people that are studying, especially at the university,
They can postpone every year until they finish the university.
And after that, they automatically go to the army.
Okay.
So when the revolution was in Syria and I saw what was happening.
I said, no, I will go outside the country,
And I don't want to participate... to go to the army, so that I don't want to be a reason for anyone to be tortured, or to be killed, or whatever else.
So I took a visa to Saudi Arabia in 2013, I guess
Sorry, 2011, ok.
I took a visa to Saudi Arabia, I went to Saudi Arabia, not knowing anyone.
There was only my friend, so we rented a house together.
I went to Jeddah, there was one of my father's friends who lived there.
So, dad spoke with him and said that Majd is coming there, so if you help him with a good job
So I found a job in Saudi Arabia.
And ever since I left for Saudi Arabia, I was thinking that I would go to Europe.
This thing was in me before, it was a perfect dream.
So I found a job and started working there.
I stayed in Saudi Arabia for a year and a half.
Then I had a friend, he was living in Kuwait.
And we had plans to go to Metal festival in Europe.
It was in the Czech Republic and in France
And we made this plan as a vacation, a one month vacation in Europe.
After that he would return to Kuwait and I would return to Saudi Arabia.
In the meantime, my passport was valid for two years because I was required to serve in the military.
So I left the job and went to extend the passport.
So I extended it.
I went to Riyadh to apply for a visa.
The embassies in Riyadh are located in the compound.
All the embassies are located in one compound, so there was a lot of obstacles.
In order to enter, you had to have an appointment and stuff like this
Except the Czech embassy, it was isolated from the rest of the embassies.
So I went and applied, ok
I had all the required documents with me.
Except there was something a little surprising.
That when I applied for the visa they asked me, why do you want to travel to the Czech Republic?
I said I want to attend a festival
ok
They told me, where is the ticket?
I didn't know that I need to have the ticket with me, ok.
So we talked with the organisers of the festival
And told them and that in any case we need to apply for a visa, me being from Syria.
And they do not give us a visa unless we have a ticket for the festival.
Approximately within twenty-four hours,
There was a bit... in those days there was not the technology like now, you can buy a ticket through the application or something.
When I got a ticket I went to the embassy, and the people from the embassy were surprised that I listen to this type of music,
Which is like death metal hardcore
Very extreme music
They were surprised by it, and they gave me the visa
So I left Saudi Arabia In 2013
I went to France
I met with my friend.
We went to the festival.
Then we went back to Prague and attended the second festival.
And then we wandered a little bit here in Czechia.
Then the trip ended, and each was supposed to go back to his country
I had about a week left from visa,
so I said that I would return to France
To France to my friend, to see the options
Because I didn't want to go back to Saudi Arabia.
Because Saudi Arabia is very much, it is not suitable for me.
I saw that it is not suitable for me in terms of weather, in terms of dealing with people and other things, okay
So I went, I returned to France and sat with my friend.
We looked at the options that were available for me
And from there, I decided to go to Norway
So I went to Norway
And tried to apply for asylum in Norway,
I even applied for university, so that I can continue
Or try external study or that I can be more educated, ok.
It did’n work out well in Norway.
I stayed in Norway for six months
There were some things within the Refugee Convention,
That one... or a person must apply for asylum in the first European country they enter.
So for me, the first European country I entered was the Czechia,
So I had to return to Czechia and apply for asylum here.
I applied for asylum here in the Czechia in 2014.
After two months, I had the interview at the airport.
After two months, I moved to another camp so that I could just wait for the decision.
After two months, two and a half months, I received the decision that I got a one-year residency.
And during that year, I had to... the decision came because the situation in Syria was very dangerous.
There was consemsus from the European Union that they cut ties with the Syrian regime.
And such stuff
There was no way that they would send me back to Syria or even to Saudi Arabia
Because Saudi Arabia is not within the human rights
The human rights Organisation.
